1. NATURAL FOODS IN A BALANCED DIET
Eat mostly fresh foods packaged by Nature, not manufactured and focus on vegetables and good quality proteins, plus fresh fruits.

2. EXERCISE
Exercising for 30 minutes a day, 5 times a week is a great goal. Develop an exercise routine that works for you! Gardening, dancing, hiking, biking, swimming, and chasing after your kids/pets can all be great exercise. Find a buddy to exercise with and make it fun.

3. STRESS MANAGEMENT
Chronic stress can lead to serious physical and mental health problems. To minimize your stress as much as possible get 150 minutes of aerobic exercise per week. Try meditation, deep breathing exercises, and mindfulness techniques.

4. SLEEP WELL
Go to sleep and wake up at roughly the same time every day. Wake up and go to sleep at the same time each day. Take naps or go to bed earlier if you feel tired during the day. Avoid caffeine at least 6 hours before bed.

5. QUIT SMOKING
It’s no secret that smoking is bad for your health. Quitting smoking improves your health in many ways. You'll heal faster, get sick less often, have more energy, and be physically stronger when you're a nonsmoker and also reduces your risk of serious health problems like heart disease, cancer, and lung disease.",

It allows you to know your strengths, weaknesses, triggers, motivators and other characteristics. While self-awareness is something that is central to who you are, it is not something that you are acutely focused on at every moment of every day. Instead, self-awareness becomes woven into the fabric of who you are and emerges at different points depending on the situation and your personality.

‘Self-awareness’ centers on recognizing and managing our emotions’

BENEFITS OF SELF-AWARENESS
1. Aids self-control, creativity, pride, and self-esteem
2. Predicts self-development, acceptance, and proactivity
3. Facilitates decision-making
4. Leads to more accurate self-reports
5. Required to develop self-control

One of your greatest pursuits in life should be to become more self-aware and realize these benefits. But being “self-aware” is not an all-or-nothing trait. There are varying levels which we can achieve.",

He proposed marriage to his crush for a long time. The lady agreed and accepted his proposal. He will celebrate the wedding with her tomorrow. He was so happy to live with her and his collected money. He could not sleep until midnight because he was delighted and excited. Suddenly, he woke up and saw a man wearing and headscarf with black clothing and standing in the moonlight. That man was holding a sharply curved blade with a long handle. His face under the headscarf looked like the skull. He could not speak because he was so frightened. He took a risk  and asked him, “ who are you ?” The man replied to him, “ I am grim Reaper.”

Your time was up in the human world so that I would take you. The man was pulling his hand. He struggled to be free from writing, but he was more muscular than him. He was dragging toward the reaper gradually. He understood he could not pull back from him. He apologized to the reaper. I want to live three days more for extra in the human world. I will marry her tomorrow. May I  stay with my wife for three days? I will give you one-third of my money. The reaper replied, “ I could not and pulled his hand .”If so, could you give me two days and I will provide you with half of a million? “I couldn’t,” he replied and pulled his hand again. Was one day possible, I will give you all my money? You could not be allowed to stay more. He replied. He knew he could not cheat to the reaper. If so  I would like to write a  letter. The reaper allowed him. He prepared to write a letter,

“ Dear Friends

When you stay in the human world, do the good deeds for your life.
I have no chance to live here one more day even though I gave the one million.
According to my story, you have seen how time was so precious. ”

FORGIVE AND DON’T HATE EACH OTHER.

PRAY WITH FAITH, ACT WITH COURAGE, NEVER SURRENDER.”

The Free Burma Rangers (FBR) is a multi-ethnic humanitarian service movement working to bring help, hope and love to people in the conflict zones of Burma, Iraq, and Sudan. Working in conjunction with local ethnic pro-democracy groups, FBR trains, supplies, and later coordinates with what become highly mobile multipurpose relief teams. After training these teams provide critical emergency medical care, shelter, food, clothing and human rights documentation in their home regions.

In addition to relief and reporting, other results of the teams’ actions are the development of leadership capacity, civil society and the strengthening of inter-ethnic unity. The teams are to avoid contact with the Burma Army or other attacking forces and operate under the protection of the ethnic resistance armies. However, they cannot run away if the people they are helping cannot escape the attacks. Men and women of many ethnic groups and religions are part of FBR.
